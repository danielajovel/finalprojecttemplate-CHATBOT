# Chatbot Template

Welcome to the Chatbot Template! This project provides a starter template for building a chatbot using **React** (frontend) and **Flask** (backend). It's designed for fellows to extend and customize to fit their needs, whether it's creating a customer support bot, a personal assistant, or something entirely unique!

## Overview
This template includes:
- A **React frontend** with a basic chat interface.
- A **Flask backend** that processes user messages.
- Example code to demonstrate how the frontend and backend communicate.

Fellows can customize the:
1. **Frontend** to change the design and add features.
2. **Backend** to enhance the bot’s logic or connect to APIs/AI models.

### Testing
1. Open the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Type a message in the chatbox and click **Send**.
